Among the 34 states in January 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy, often simply called the South, grew to include eleven states, and although they claimed thirteen states and additional western territories, the Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by any foreign country. The states that remained loyal and did not declare secession were known as the Union or the North. The war had its origin in the factious issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. After four years of combat, which had left around 750,000 Americans, Union and Confederate, dead and had destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed and slavery was abolished. Then began the Reconstruction and the processes of restoring national unity and guaranteeing civil rights to the freed slaves.","passages":[{"passageId":"7896:243:414","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":243,"passageEnd":414,"passageText":"Among the 34 states in January 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America.","facts":[]}]}

The union produced one child, Dalton Bruce (born October 4, 1989) (who can be seen in Terminator 2: Judgment Day as \"Infant John Connor\"). Bruce and Linda divorced circa 1989. That same year, on the Dallas, Texas, set of the television film Trapped, Abbott met actress Kathleen Quinlan. They married April 12, 1994 and have 1 son, Tyler Quinlan (born October 17, 1990).

The tensions began in August 18, when the Syrian government presided by Shukri al-Quwatli made a series of provocative institutional changes, such as the appointment of Col. Afif al-Bizri as chief-of-staff of the Syrian Army, who was alleged by Western governments of being a Soviet sympathizer. Suspicion that a communist takeover had occurred in Damascus grew larger, prompting neighboring Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon to consider supporting an Arab or Western military intervention to overthrown the Syrian government. Turkey was the only country to step in by deploying thousands of troops along the Syrian-Turkish border. Nikita Khrushchev threatened that he would launch missiles at Turkey if it attacks Syria, while the United States said that it could attack the Soviet Union in response to an assault on Turkey. The crisis ended in late October, when Turkey agreed to cease its border operations following pressure by the United States, and when Khrushchev made an unexpected visit to the Turkish embassy in Moscow. The events are widely seen as a major failure of the Eisenhower Doctrine, which stressed that the United States could intervene militarily on behalf of a Middle Eastern ally to fight \"international communism\".","passages":[{"passageId":"7575:263:558","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":263,"passageEnd":558,"passageText":"The tensions began in August 18, when the Syrian government presided by Shukri al-Quwatli made a series of provocative institutional changes, such as the appointment of Col.

He was the son of Richard Cooper senior (1701-1764) and his wife Anne Lind. He is considered one of Britain's Grand Masters in Watercolour and Drawing. Despite this, little is known about him. He was an exhibitor at the Royal Academy. Cooper succeeded Alexander Cuzens as Drawing Master at Eton College and taught members of the Royal Family. Queen Charlotte was England's enthusiastic Patron of the Arts and Queen to King George III. Queen Charlotte was interested in the arts and music. Cooper was her art teacher. Cooper was taught by his father before moving to Paris to train under the engraver, J. P. Le Bas. Cooper went to Italy around 1770 but by 1778 he was back in Britain. Original works are rare; The Tate has five original works and five prints; The Government Art Collection has five prints; the National Portrait Gallery, London has one original work and nine prints. The British Museum, however, has over ninety objects attributed to him including ten drawings and seventy four prints. Cooper's work is typically dark, as he specialised in charcoal, pencil, pen and ink. He drew with a reed pen, which he used with rapid and flowing movements to produce strongly contrasted areas of light and shade. The yellow-brown tone of his broad washes suggest the ink used was bistre. The washes were diluted and applied over the iron gall pen work, causing the ink lines underneath to \"bleed\". The sheet is left bare in places to suggest falling sunlight. He would often sketch a scene to complete it in his studio years later. His subjects include Edward Kynaston, Sir Robert Naunton, John Lilburne, Mary Frith and Daniel Dancer. His landscapes often included the Thames riverbank, and around Windsor Castle, where he used his connections to gain access.","passages":[{"passageId":"13582:507:598","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":507,"passageEnd":598,"passageText":"Queen Charlotte was England's enthusiastic Patron of the Arts and Queen to King George III.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"13582:164:239","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":164,"passageEnd":239,"passageText":"He was the son of Richard Cooper senior (1701-1764) and his wife Anne Lind.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"13582:20:163","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":20,"passageEnd":163,"passageText":"Richard Cooper (or Richard Cooper Jr. or Richard Cooper II) was born in Edinburgh on 6 February 1740 and died at Eltham, Kent in December 1822.","facts":[]}]}

Initially (1984) known as Guitar Center of Minneapolis, renamed to Musictech College, moved to St. Paul in 2001, and was re-labeled again as McNally Smith College of Music by the school's two founders, Jack McNally and Doug Smith, to memorialize themselves on the school's 2005 20th anniversary. Initially, the school's concept was vocational, with the goal of providing students with real world skills with which to earn a living in the music industry. The vocational school began with six instructors and 200 private lesson students in a 3,000 square foot space within the Minneapolis warehouse district. In the fall of 1986 The Guitar Center began offering a state-approved full-time program. By 2000 the guitar school had become a music college, with over 250 students pursuing associate degrees and diploma certificates. The college purchased and renovated a former St Paul Arts & Science Center building into a 60,000 square foot campus with a 12-studio audio complex, customized classrooms, library, bookstore, café, and 300-seat auditorium with a 20k-watt Midas/EV sound system. In 2005, the reorganized and more traditional liberal arts school, McNally Smith College of Music, moved away from vocational training with higher tuition and overall costs, more liberal arts course requirements, and dramatically more administrative overhead. School enrollment peaked in 2007 and began a downhill slide to the eventual demise in December, 2017. The college attempted to operate a European campus at the Media Docks in Lübeck, Germany, opening in 2004.

The son of a clergyman who was also a politician, Horne had a burgeoning business career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley. In 1958 Horne suffered a stroke and gave up his business dealings to focus on his entertainment work. He was the anchor figure in Beyond Our Ken, which also featured Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and Bill Pertwee.

{"fold":5,"source":"DBpedia Abstract","documentId":"8174","documentText":"Peter Gideon Farmhouse\n\nPeter Gideon (1820-1899) was a farmer near Excelsior, Minnesota, United States, who was responsible for breeding apples that could withstand Minnesota's climate. Gideon's farmhouse, now within the boundaries of Shorewood, Minnesota, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Gideon moved to Minnesota in 1853, near Lake Minnetonka, and experimented with planting pear, plum, cherry, peach, and apple seeds. After ten years of experimentation, the harsh Minnesota winters had killed off all of his trees except for one seedling crab apple tree. Instead of giving up, he sent back to Bangor, Maine for seeds and scions, and continued his experiments by grafting a scion onto the crab apple tree. From this experiment, in 1868 he successfully selected a variety of apple that he named the \"Wealthy\", in honor of his wife. In March 1878, Minnesota established a State Experimental Fruit Farm by act of the Legislature which Gideon ran for eleven years, planting many thousands of apple trees and distributing his best seeds across the state. The state farm was located near Gideon's land on Lake Minnetonka, under the jurisdiction of the University of Minnesota. When the farm closed in February 1889 due to conflicts with the University, Gideon lost his job. Gideon later became the first superintendent of a University of Minnesota agricultural experiment station established in 1878. The station was abandoned in 1889, when he retired, but in 1907 the Minnesota Legislature established a fruit breeding farm between Excelsior and Chaska. The fruit breeding farm later became the Horticultural Research Center, which is now part of the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum. The center later developed the Haralson apple, introduced in 1922. The Wealthy apple is genetically related to the Haralson, though it took DNA testing to rediscover this fact after extensive hybridization.","passages":[{"passageId":"8174:312:443","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":312,"passageEnd":443,"passageText":"Gideon moved to Minnesota in 1853, near Lake Minnetonka, and experimented with planting pear, plum, cherry, peach, and apple seeds.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"8174:1420:1573","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":1420,"passageEnd":1573,"passageText":"The station was abandoned in 1889, when he retired, but in 1907 the Minnesota Legislature established a fruit breeding farm between Excelsior and Chaska.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"8174:186:311","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":186,"passageEnd":311,"passageText":"Gideon's farmhouse, now within the boundaries of Shorewood, Minnesota, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.","facts":[]}]}

Oster claims that the ET3 system will be able to provide 50 times the amount of transportation per kilowatt-hour compared with electric cars and electric trains, costing only 20 cents worth of electrical energy to get up to 350 mph. ET3 claims that initial systems would travel at the speed of 600 km/h (370 mph) for in state trips, and later will be developed to 6,500 km/h (4,000 mph, hypersonic speed) for international travel that will allow passenger or cargo travel from New York to Beijing in 2 hours. The initial proof of concept system could be built in as little 3 years for operational transport. ET3 is an IP company that filed two new patents in 2014. Individuals can buy a license for a one-time fee of $100 while institutes or companies can buy a license for $500. An individual, billionaire, multinational or a consortium that wants to build ET3 can only do so with a license in good standing. For any trajectory they build, they retain 94% of the revenues.

In Mozart's own catalogue of his works, this concerto is dated 30 September 1784. For years, historical speculation was that Mozart had written this concerto for Maria Theresa von Paradis, based on a letter written around that time by Leopold Mozart to his daughter Nannerl. However, Hermann Ullrich has discounted this theory, based on the date of entry in Mozart's catalogue and the fact that von Paradis had left Paris at the start of October 1784, which indicated that there was not sufficient time to send von Paradis the concerto for performance. Richard Maunder has countered with the idea that Mozart could still have sent the concerto to Paris, and that it would have been forwarded to von Paradis in London, where it was possible that she performed the work in March 1785. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. The concerto is in three movements: Mozart wrote out two different cadenzas for the first movement. Joseph Swain has performed a Schenkerian analysis of each first-movement cadenza. Martha Kingdon Ward has commented that the slow movement of this concerto contains one of the \"most tranquil\" of Mozart's flute solos, specifically in the G major variation. M.S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the finale, starting at measure 171, from 6/8 to 2/4 in the winds, with the piano following at measure 179. This changing of tempo in rondo finales was contrary to common practice at the time. Joel Galand has performed a Schenkerian analysis of the rondo finale, and noted features such as its novel use of ♭II as a remote key.","passages":[{"passageId":"16337:255:447","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":255,"passageEnd":447,"passageText":"For years, historical speculation was that Mozart had written this concerto for Maria Theresa von Paradis, based on a letter written around that time by Leopold Mozart to his daughter Nannerl.","facts":[]}]}

The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, and politics. He was on the editorial board of Les Temps modernes, the leftist magazine created by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945. At the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world. Like the other major phenomenologists, Merleau-Ponty expressed his philosophical insights in writings on art, literature, linguistics, and politics. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences and especially with descriptive psychology. It is through this engagement that his writings have become influential in the recent project of naturalizing phenomenology, in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science. Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call “indirect ontology” or the ontology of “the flesh of the world” (la chair du monde), seen in his last incomplete work, The Visible and Invisible, and his last published essay, “Eye and Mind”.","passages":[{"passageId":"7910:314:424","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":314,"passageEnd":424,"passageText":"He was on the editorial board of Les Temps modernes, the leftist magazine created by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"7910:23:196","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":23,"passageEnd":196,"passageText":"Maurice Merleau-Ponty ([mɔʁis mɛʁlopɔ̃ti]; 14 March 1908 – 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger.","facts":[]}]}

Nupen was born in South Africa to a family of Norwegian descent — his father, E. P. \"Buster\" Nupen (1902–1977), was a Test cricketer. After studying law at university he moved to Britain to work in banking, then trained as a sound engineer with the BBC. In 1962 he made High Festival In Siena about the summer music school at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena for BBC Radio Three and was subsequently invited by Huw Weldon to make films for the BBC. Using newly developed silent 16mm film cameras he created a new, intimate style of biographical film beginning with Double Concerto in 1966, featuring the collaboration of Vladimir Ashkenazy and Daniel Barenboim. In 1968 he co-founded Allegro Films, one of the earliest independent television production companies in the UK. He went on to work on over 80 film and television productions about music. The Trout, his film of a performance of Schubert’s Trout quintet by Jacqueline du Pré, Daniel Barenboim, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zuckerman and Zubin Mehta on August 30, 1969 at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, became a benchmark of classical music broadcasting. His close friendships with many of his subjects enabled him to communicate the spirit of the artists' work, such as in Jacqueline Du Pré In Portrait. Surveys of the life and work of composers have also featured prominently in his work, including films about Paganini, Sibelius and Schubert.

A native of Transylvania, he graduated from Budapest University, after which he was ordained. He was initially assigned to a parish in the Apuseni Mountains, which form the backdrop to much of his fiction. Before 1910, Agârbiceanu had achieved literary fame in both Transylvania and the Kingdom of Romania; his work was disputed between the rival schools of Sămănătorul and Poporanism. Committed to social and cultural activism in Transylvania, Agârbiceanu spent the 1910s officiating near Sibiu, with a break during World War I that eventually took him deep into Ukraine. In 1919, he moved to Cluj, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. After the war, he involved himself in both the political and cultural life of Greater Romania. He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship. Agârbiceanu spent his last decade and a half under a communist regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, with the possible exception of his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.","passages":[{"passageId":"8234:177:270","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":177,"passageEnd":270,"passageText":"A native of Transylvania, he graduated from Budapest University, after which he was ordained.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"8234:750:830","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":750,"passageEnd":830,"passageText":"In 1919, he moved to Cluj, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"8234:926:1063","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":926,"passageEnd":1063,"passageText":"He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship.","facts":[]}]}

The company was sold to Roy Burlew in 1918 who used it to create the Kentucky Radio Corporation, later known as Ken-Rad, which operated out of the same building. Burlew grew the company significantly as the lamp plant continued to grow, Burlew expanded into the manufacturing of vacuum tubes for radios in 1922. Within seven years of purchasing the company it had expanded with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky and Tell City and Huntingburg, Indiana. The manufacturing company supplied the light bulbs for the first Major League Baseball game played at night. The game was played on May 24, 1935, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. In 1943, Burlew sold the lamp division which he acquired in 1918 for $55,000 to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in exchange of 35,000 shares of that company's stock valued at $1,600,000. Ken-Rad was secured several government and defense contracts during World War II. The company grew to be very important to the war effort, and when it was threatened by a strike in 1944 it was seized by the Department of War under order of President Roosevelt. In 1945 Burlew sold the remainder of the company, the tube division, to General Electric and became GE's primary tube making facility. In 1987, GE sold the company to a group of investors who formed a company called MPD, Inc. From 1921 to 2006 the building served as home to Smith Machine and Supply, Inc.

The table was used by monarchs from the 13th century onward for coronation feasts and state banquets. Edward I, the king who took the Stone of Scone from Scotland, was the first English monarch recorded to have used it. The mid 13th-century style of carving means that the table could date back to Henry III. Henry VIII used the table for feasts after his marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. The King's Table was broken into pieces by Oliver Cromwell following the English Civil War and buried under the Palace of Westminster. A new table was created during the English Restoration. The broken pieces of the original were placed in the foundations of a dais built in the 17th century in Westminster Hall, which was used by James II of England at his coronation banquet. The first piece of the table was rediscovered in the 1960s beneath the floor of Westminster Hall.

Laszlo argues that companies creating sustainable value are going beyond regulatory compliance and energy conservation. They are differentiating their products by making them more accessible (or less toxic) and finding new products that address environmental and social problems, and then driving the innovation into supply that are more “green” in both senses of the word. The book gives a detailed account of the real-life sustainability stories of DuPont, Wal-Mart, Lafarge, and Cargill’s NatureWorks. The first section of the book is a management fable about a young CEO and the challenges she faces in addressing her company's impact on society and the environment, while remaining profitable. Part II outlines the new competitive environment in which societal challenges become huge business opportunities. Part III introduces the Sustainable Value tool-kit— a step-by-step approach to creating and managing value for stakeholders in a broad range of sectors in today's shifting competitive environment.

One of the last great Rococo buildings to be designed in Europe, the palace was conceived as a summer retreat for Dom Pedro of Braganza, later to become husband and then king consort to his own niece, Queen Maria I. It served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness continued in the years following Dom Pedro's death in 1786. Following the destruction by fire of the Ajuda Palace in 1794, Queluz Palace became the official residence of the Portuguese prince regent, John VI, and his family and remained so until the Royal Family fled to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1807 following the French invasion of Portugal. Work on the palace began in 1747 under the architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira. Despite being far smaller, the palace is often referred to as the Portuguese Versailles. From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state. Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted the interior, the palace was extensively restored, and today is open to the public as a major tourist attraction. One wing of the palace, the Pavilion of Dona Maria, built between 1785 and 1792 by the architect Manuel Caetano de Sousa, is now a guest house allocated to foreign heads of state visiting Portugal.","passages":[{"passageId":"24763:448:598","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":448,"passageEnd":598,"passageText":"It served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness continued in the years following Dom Pedro's death in 1786.","facts":[]}]}

He played for the Kansas City Athletics, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, and Cincinnati Reds. Stahl was signed by the Athletics in 1960 as an amateur free agent. He broke into the big leagues on September 11, 1964, going 0-1 as a pinch-hitter against Wally Bunker in a 5-2 Kansas City loss to the Baltimore Orioles in Memorial Stadium. After brief appearances in several more games, he notched his first career hit on September 19 at Yankee Stadium in an 8-3 loss to the New York Yankees. Pinch-hitting for pitcher Orlando Peña in the sixth inning, he hit a ground-rule double off Ralph Terry. Playing for the Padres on September 2, 1972, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Stahl drew one of the most questionable bases on balls in baseball history — if only because of the circumstances surrounding it. Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas had retired the first 26 Padres hitters and was one strike away from a perfect game with a 2-2 count against pinch-hitter Stahl. However, home plate umpire Bruce Froemming called the next two pitches, both of which were close, balls. To date, the perfect game bid is the only one in Major League history to be broken up by a walk to the 27th batter. Pappas secured his no-hitter by retiring Garry Jestadt one batter later. Primarily an outfielder, his best year was 1971 at age 30 when, in 114 games for the Padres, he hit .253 with eight home runs and 36 runs batted in. He had exactly 400 career hits.

The NCAA divided Division I into two divisions for football in 1978. The top level, originally known as \"Division I-A\" and officially changed to the \"Football Bowl Subdivision\" in 2006, includes teams that play in bowl games. The second level, originally known as \"Division I-AA\" and renamed the \"Football Championship Subdivision\" in 2006, consists of smaller schools and conferences, most of which play in a playoff system (although a few conferences, such as the Ivy League, choose not to participate in the playoff). The larger schools, who do not have a playoff system, concludes with a series of bowl games that have developed as a reward for teams that do well in the regular season. The 2006–07 schedule served as the largest post-season lineup ever, with the addition of the new stand-alone Bowl Championship Series National Championship Game as well as four new games – the International Bowl in Toronto, Ontario (which is the first postseason game to be played outside the USA since the last Bacardi Bowl was played in Havana, Cuba in 1937), the Papajohns.com Bowl, the New Mexico Bowl, and the post-season-ending Texas vs. The Nation Game – all as part of a record 38 post-season games (32 not counting the post-BCS all-star games) that were scheduled between the Poinsettia Bowl on December 19, 2006, and the aforementioned Texas vs. The Nation Game on February 2, 2007. Thus, 64 schools out of the 119 schools in the Bowl Subdivision were playing in the post-season, thanks in part to the NCAA's decision to expand schedules to twelve regular season mainland games (not counting games either played in Hawaii or conference championships in the ACC, Big 12, SEC, MAC or Conference USA) and allow teams with a 6–6 record to be bowl eligible if either the team or their conference has negotiated a bowl contract.","passages":[{"passageId":"18368:216:372","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":216,"passageEnd":372,"passageText":"The top level, originally known as \"Division I-A\" and officially changed to the \"Football Bowl Subdivision\" in 2006, includes teams that play in bowl games.","facts":[]}]}

Born in Munich, he graduated from the University of Munich shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. He was Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Heidelberg. Following the murder of a friend, he attended the trial where he saw that the judge completely ignored evidence against the Brown Shirts Nazis. Horrified, he ardently investigated many similar political murders that had occurred and published his findings in Four Years of Political Murder in 1922. In 1928, he published Causes of Political Murder and also tried to create a political group to counter Nazism. Gumbel was also one of the 33 signers of the 1932 Dringender Appell. Among the Nazi's most-hated public intellectuals, he was forced out of his position in Heidelberg in 1932. Gumbel then moved to France, where he taught in Paris and Lyon, and then to the United States in 1940. He taught at the École Libre Des Hautes Études in Paris and at the New School for Social Research and Columbia University in New York City until his death in 1966. As a mathematician, Gumbel was instrumental in the development of extreme value theory, along with Leonard Tippett and Ronald Fisher. In 1958, Gumbel published a key book on the topic: Statistics of Extremes. He derived and analyzed the probability distribution that is now known as the Gumbel distribution in his honor.

Mackie was born at Cochin, India and as a child returned to live in Derry before attending school in Twickenham, Middlesex. He later entered Trinity College, Cambridge and became a member of the Inner Temple in November 1822. He arrived at Fremantle on the Caroline on 12 October 1829 with two servants, John Bludsell and Richard Holland. Mackie was a cousin of Captain Frederick Irwin who was the commandant of the troops in the colony and who had arrived on the Sulphur four months earlier. Mackie and Irwin acquired two large land grants in the new colony, jointly taking up 3240 acres (13.1 km²) at Henley Park in the Upper Swan and another 7000 acres (28 km²) between Beverley and York. Mackie's legal background saw him appointed as one of eight Justices of the Peace by Lieutenant-Governor Stirling in December 1829. In October 1831 Stirling appointed Mackie as one of the foundation members of the Western Australian Legislative Council in the position of Advocate-General. In June 1834 he resigned from the Council and became the Commissioner of the Civil Court, thus presiding over the civil and criminal courts of the colony. South Australian Governor George Grey (later to become Governor of New Zealand) offered him the position of Advocate-General of South Australia in 1841, but Mackie declined. In August 1842 he was made a nominee member of the Legislative Council.

This villa was constructed in 1582 by Cardinal Bonanni. It was sold in 1617 to the banker Roberto Primo who constructed the 'teatro d'acqua' (water theatre) at the far end of the garden. The theatre is a direct copy of that at the nearby Villa Mondragone, for whom Primo acted as a banker. The clock, or 'orologio' was added in the nineteenth century while the villa was in the ownership of the Lancellotti family. The villa was restored in 1730, by the new owner Prince Pietro Piccolomini. In 1840 the Villa, called Villa Piccolomini, was sold to Francis Mehlem of Bavaria. The villa was bought and restored in 1866 by Prince Filippo Massimo Lancellotti and his wife Princess Elisabetta Borghese Aldobrandini. King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia, lived here, and in October 1805 he received Pope Pius VII as a guest.

In 2012 Elder Gallery relocated to a beautiful gallery space in Charlotte’s Southend District. The gallery was designed for large art exhibitions and personal and corporate events.\nWhen the investment market plunged in 2008 so did the art market. I saw this as an opportunity to rally support for artists living and working in North and South Carolina and founded an art competition called Carolina’s Got Art! Now in its fourth year this highly-anticipated competition has grown to be one of the most prestigious art events in the southeast and awards significant cash and prizes to those artists whose work is selected by nationally recognized art critics and curators.\nMy goal is to offer some of the best contemporary art being created by American artists and to help educate the public with exhibitions that not only entertain but challenge.","passages":[{"passageId":"3816:789:955","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":789,"passageEnd":955,"passageText":"The purchase of the Carl Plansky Collection in 2011 created a necessity for more storage and exhibition space for the 1500+ pieces of art contained in the collection.","facts":[]},{"passageId":"3816:1203:1365","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":1203,"passageEnd":1365,"passageText":"I saw this as an opportunity to rally support for artists living and working in North and South Carolina and founded an art competition called Carolina’s Got Art!","facts":[]}]}

At the age of thirty-three, he became a hermit in the region of Mount Mercurion in the north of Calabria. There, many monasteries and hermitages had been established under the Basilian rule. Fantinus lived a life of extreme asceticism, eating only raw vegetables, and occupying his time copying manuscripts. He also experienced a vision of heaven and hell. Fantinus lived both as a hermit and as a monk and abbot. He subsequently convinced his aged parents, as well as his two brothers, Luke and Cosmas, and sister Caterina, to enter the monastic life.

He then went to work at the Department of Mathematics of Shandong University. He was honored with an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Science in 1991. Previously, Wang Yuang made progress toward Goldbach’s Conjecture on the distribution of prime numbers. His result was that for any sufficiently large even number, that number is the sum of two numbers—one a product of at most two primes, the other a product of at most three primes. This case is denoted by (2,3). In 1962, Pan Chengdong also made progress in proving Goldbach’s conjecture by proving the (1,5) case independently and the (1,4) case the following year with N.B.

Circa 1820 Cherokee Chief George Welch constructed a grist mill, saw mill, and a simple open bridge at the site on this tributary of the Etowah River. Welch continued to run and maintain the mills and bridge until the Cherokee removal in 1838. The land that held the bridge and mills was won in the land lottery by John Maynard of Jackson County, Georgia who sold the land to Jacob Scudder. Following Scudder's death in 1870 the mill and bridge were bought by Dr. M.L. Pool. A cotton gin was added at the site in 1920 but cotton was all but abandoned by local farmers when the poultry industry was introduced. The mill was left in disuse by 1947 and was burned by vandals in 1959. The original bridge that stood at the site was washed away in a flood in 1899. It was decided that a new bridge in using the Lattice truss bridge style would be built on the site. The design called for wooden pegs to be driven holes bored into wooden beams to hold the design together. The beams were cut on site at the saw mill, but the holes were bored in the wrong positions. At this point the construction was taken over by Bud Gentry, who oversaw the redrilling of the holes. The misdrilled holes can still be seen in the bridge's beams. In the mid-1990s the bridge began to sag and a revitalization effort began. A support pier was built in the creek in the middle. During this revitalization private citizens also donated land in the area to allow the creation of Poole's Mill Park.","passages":[{"passageId":"7832:562:645","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":562,"passageEnd":645,"passageText":"Following Scudder's death in 1870 the mill and bridge were bought by Dr. M.L.

She was the wife of Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena, whom she married in February 1579. This was the duke's third marriage, and it was hoped that she would produce a male heir. She did not, which partially led to the city of Ferrara's acquisition by the Papal States. Margherita was born and raised in her father's court in Mantua. Alfonso's concerto delle donne was formed in part to please her, and all of the members were on the court rolls as her ladies in waiting, and the concerts were frequently held in her apartments. When she married she used her influence at Mantua to convince her father to allow Livia d'Arco, a Mantuan, to join the Ferrarese court as one of her ladies in waiting, so that she could participate in the concerto delle donne.

He served as the minister of major mosques in Boston and Harlem, and was appointed by the longtime NOI leader, Elijah Muhammad, as the National Representative of the Nation of Islam. After Warith Deen Muhammad disbanded the NOI and started the orthodox Islamic group American Society of Muslims, Farrakhan started rebuilding the NOI. In 1981 he revived the name Nation of Islam for his organization, previously known as Final Call, regaining many of the Nation of Islam's National properties including the NOI National Headquarters Mosque Maryam, reopening over 130 NOI mosques in America and the world. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Farrakhan as antisemitic and a proponent of an anti-white theology. Farrakhan himself, however, disputes this view of his ideology. Farrakhan is a black religious and social leader. Farrakhan has been both praised and widely criticized for his often controversial political views and outspoken rhetorical style. He has been criticized for remarks that have been perceived as antisemitic, anti-white and homophobic. In October 1995, he organized and led the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., calling on black men to renew their commitments to their families and communities. Farrakhan, due to health issues, reduced his responsibilities with the NOI in 2007. In recent years, however, Farrakhan has been very active, including delivering weekly online sermons throughout 2013 as well as speaking at both large public NOI events as well as smaller venues. Since 2010, Farrakhan has advocated L Ron Hubbard's Dianetics and the use of its \"auditing\" technique despite not being a Scientologist.

Born in Aigburth, Liverpool, he began his playing career with Everton and made 12 league appearances for the club, making his debut in the 1–2 defeat to Manchester City on 26 December 1922. During his time at Goodison Park, he was never able to replace Sam Chedgzoy as the club's first choice right-winger, and in June 1926 he joined Football League Second Division side Grimsby Town. However, despite being described as \"a skilful and polished winger\", Parry again struggled to break into the first team and played just one league match in the 1926–27 season. In the summer of 1927, Parry moved to Third Division North outfit Accrington Stanley and immediately found himself more involved in senior football. In just over two years with the Peel Park club, he made 81 league appearances and scored 10 goals. His form for Accrington attracted the attention of other clubs, and three months into the 1929–30 season Parry was signed by Nelson as a replacement for Gerry Kelly, who had joined Huddersfield Town. He made his debut for the club on 9 November 1929 in the goalless draw at home to Lincoln City. He retained the right wing berth for the majority of the season, missing only four matches. Parry scored his first league goal for Nelson in the 2–2 draw with Carlisle United on 25 December 1929 at Seedhill, and also netted in the return fixture at Brunton Park the following month. He left Nelson in May 1930 and subsequently moved into non-League football, signing for Felling Stanley, his last senior club, in September of the same year.

The estate was sold by Mary Hay, 14th Countess of Erroll, in the 1730s. Major development commenced when the land was owned by the merchant Patrick Milne in the late 18th and early 19th-centuries and the estate is now most famous for Crimonmogate House, designed by the Aberdeen architect Archibald Simpson for Milne. The Greek Revival building is protected as a category A listed building and the grounds are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. After Milne's death the estate passed to the Bannerman family who continued to develop the lands and completed the construction of the mansion, also adding a mansard roof later. Simpson was commissioned to design further structures within the estate. Eventually, through marriage in the 20th century, the estate returned to the Errolls. Almost at the turn of that century, in 1996, the estate was purchased by Christopher Monckton, who began restoration work on the mansion. As a publicity stunt, Monckton falsely claimed in 2000 that he was having to offer it for sale to pay prize money after the Eternity puzzle was solved years sooner than anticipated.

As the son of journalist José Luis Sainz, Gustavo Sainz learned how to read at the age of three from his paternal grandmother, and started publishing his work in the city newspapers at the age of ten. When he was in primary school, Sainz founded several school magazines, which he continued to do until college. At the age of eighteen, Sainz left home to work as a journalist in the magazine Visión. In 1960, he entered the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, where he began studying law, but ultimately changed to study literature. Sainz's first novel, Gazapo, was published when he was twenty-five and has been translated into fourteen languages. This novel marked the beginning of the literary movement \"la Onda\", of which other Mexican writers, such as José Agustín and Parmenides García Saldaña, formed part. In 1968, Sainz travelled to the University of Iowa to participate in the International Writing Program, where he started and completed his second novel, Obsesivos días circulares. Sainz's longest novel, A la salud de la serpiente, relates his adventures of this period in Iowa. Upon his return to Mexico, he wrote La princesa del Palacio de Hierro, which won the Premio Xavier Villaurrutia in 1974. It was translated into English by Andrew Hurley and published as \"The Princess of the Iron Palace\" by Grove Press in 1987. In 2003, he published A troche y moche, which won the prize for the best novel of the year written in Mexico, and its translation into French won the award for best novel in Quebec. His work includes eighteen published novels, countless articles, and various children's books. Sainz was the editor of the magazine Transgresiones.

His aesthetic philosophy and technique were influenced by an earlier generation of abstract filmmakers that included Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling, Walter Ruttmann, and Fernand Léger, whose work he discovered while living in Europe. Breer was also influenced by the concept of Neo-plasticism as described by Piet Mondrian and Vasarely. After experimenting with cartoon animation as a child, he started making his first abstract experimental films while living in Paris from 1949 to 1959, a period during which he also showed paintings and kinetic sculptures at galleries such as the renowned Galerie Denise René. Breer explained some of the reasons behind his move from painting to filmmaking in a 1976 interview: Breer also taught at Cooper Union in New York from 1971 to 2001. Breer died on August 11, 2011 at his home in Tucson.

Whedon served as an executive producer, along with Tim Minear. The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a \"Firefly-class\" spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon pitched the show as \"nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things\". The show explores the lives of a group of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the fringe of society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures. According to Whedon's vision, \"nothing will change in the future: technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today\". Firefly premiered in the U.S. on the Fox network on September 20, 2002. By mid-December, Firefly had averaged 4.7 million viewers per episode and was 98th in Nielsen ratings. It was canceled after eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the relatively short life span of the series, it received strong sales when it was released on DVD and has large fan support campaigns. It won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2003 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. TV Guide ranked the series at No. 5 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were \"Cancelled Too Soon\". The post-airing success of the show led Whedon and Universal Pictures to produce Serenity, a 2005 film which continues from the story of the series, and the Firefly franchise expanded to other media, including comics and a role-playing game.","passages":[{"passageId":"7736:21:167","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":21,"passageEnd":167,"passageText":"Firefly is an American space western drama television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon, under his Mutant Enemy Productions label.","facts":[]}]}

Enhanced remakes were later released on the Super NES in 1993 and the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game has been re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U consoles. Super Mario Bros. 3 centers on plumbers Mario and Luigi who embark on a quest to save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser and his children, the Koopalings. The player, as Mario or Luigi, is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers. Mario and Luigi are given a wider range of abilities than in previous Super Mario games, including flying or sliding down slopes. In addition, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements, such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels, that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games. Super Mario Bros. 3 is acclaimed by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time. It was a commercial success upon release, which was partly influenced by its promotion in the 1989 film The Wizard. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the third-best selling NES game, having sold over 17 million copies worldwide. The popularity of the game also inspired a short-lived animated television series.","passages":[{"passageId":"5239:401:519","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":401,"passageEnd":519,"passageText":"The game was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, led by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.","facts":[]}]}

Kromiadi became close with captured Soviet general Andrey Vlasov, thus becoming Vlasov's first White emigre ally. In 1943, Vlasov gave Kromiadi command of his headquarters. Kromiadi made several attempts to attract White emigres to General Vlasov, and was finally successful by the time of the Prague Manifesto, having secured the support of two branches of the Russian Orthodox Church.

It is one-way (west to east) for buses and taxis, two-way for cyclists outside main shopping hours, and forbidden for cars. It runs west from the centre of Oxford at Carfax. Here it adjoins Cornmarket Street to the north (also pedestrianised), the High Street continuing east, and St Aldate's to the south. Halfway along on the north side is an entrance to the Clarendon Centre, a shopping centre.At the western end is Bonn Square, named after the German city of Bonn with which Oxford is twinned, and the Westgate Shopping Centre, where the old city gate to the west used to be located. New Inn Hall Street leads north from near here. Close by is the mound of Oxford Castle and the old Oxford Prison off New Road, which leads on to the west towards the Oxford railway station. In the 13th century, the street was known as the Bailey due to its proximity with the castle. Cattle were slaughtered and the meat sold here, so the street later became known as Butcher Row. The slaughtering of animals in the street was outlawed by the Oxford Mileways Act of 1771 and the butchers moved to the Covered Market. The street was then named Queen Street after Queen Charlotte, the wife of King George III, who both visited Oxford in 1785. There were many gabled and timer-framed buildings here until the late 19th century. Until 1932, there was a showroom for Morris Garages in the street. In 1970, the street was pedestrianised. The buildings have mostly been replaced with modern stores, such as the Marks & Spencer shop on the south side of the street, built in 1975–8. Until 2009 many of the city's eastbound buses stopped here, and so it was frequently busy with people waiting for a bus.[citation needed]","passages":[{"passageId":"13668:1204:1327","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":1204,"passageEnd":1327,"passageText":"The street was then named Queen Street after Queen Charlotte, the wife of King George III, who both visited Oxford in 1785.","facts":[]}]}

The home, originally designated as 367 Addison Avenue, was first occupied in 1905 by Dr. John Spencer, his wife Ione, and their two adult daughters. Dr. Spencer became Palo Alto's first mayor in 1909. In 1918, the house was divided into two separate apartments, numbered 367 and 369. In 1937, David \"Dave\" Packard, then 25 years old, visited William \"Bill\" Hewlett in Palo Alto and the pair had their first business meeting. In 1938, newly married Dave and Lucile Packard moved into 367 Addison Ave, the first floor three-room apartment, with Bill Hewlett sleeping in the shed. Mrs. Spencer, now widowed, moved into the second floor apartment, 369 Addison. Hewlett and Packard began to use the one-car garage, with $538 in capital. In 1939, Hewlett and Packard formed their partnership, with a coin toss creating the name Hewlett-Packard. Hewlett-Packard's first product, built in the garage, was an audio oscillator, the HP200A. One of Hewlett-Packard's first customers was Walt Disney Studios, which purchased eight oscillators to test and certify the sound systems in theaters that were going to run the first major film released in stereophonic sound, Fantasia.

The Separatists’ main complaints were the perceived under-representation of the Central region in the colonial Parliament, located in Brisbane, some 700 kilometres (430 mi) to the south of Rockhampton, and the use of Central Queensland taxes and finances to fund the Queensland Government. Agitation for the division of Queensland into two or three smaller colonies had been a political question in the colony ever since Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859. Earlier, unsuccessful, political movements for Central Queensland secession from Queensland had been launched in the 1860s and 1870s. George Curtis (1845–1922), a prominent Rockhampton auctioneer and landholder, became the first president of the CQTSL and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland (the lower house of the Queensland Parliament) in 1893 where he used his position to agitate for the aims of the CQTSL in Parliament. Archibald Archer and John Ferguson visited England as a deputation on behalf of the Central Queensland Territorial Separation League in 1892. They met with Lord Knutsford, who preferred that to Sir Samuel Griffith's provincial district resolutions were carried in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The CQTSL’s campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. When the Australian colonies federated in 1901, the new nation’s Constitution placed the power to further divide colonies (or States as they now became) in the hands of the parent colony or state, with no avenue for referral to the British Government. Further movements for the establishment of a new state in Central Queensland, with Rockhampton as the capital, occurred in the 1950s.","passages":[{"passageId":"18399:1307:1465","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":1307,"passageEnd":1465,"passageText":"They met with Lord Knutsford, who preferred that to Sir Samuel Griffith's provincial district resolutions were carried in the Queensland Legislative Assembly.","facts":[]}]}

According to Chimalpahin, Tehuetzquititzin's father Tezcatl Popocatzin was a son of Tizoc, the seventh ruler of Tenochtitlan. He took as his Christian wife his first cousin, doña María, with whom he had two children, don Alonso Tezcatl Popocatzin and don Pablo (or Pedro) Mauhcaxochitzin, both of whom died young. By other women he had also had children named don Miguel (or Pablo) Ixcuinantzin (who also died young), don Pedro Xiconocatzin, don José Xaxaqualiuhtocatzin, don Baltasar Ilhuicaxochitzin (who also died young), doña Juana, doña María Tlacoyehuatzin, doña María Francisca, another doña María, and doña Cecilia. Tehuetzquititzin became both tlatoani and governor of Tenochtitlan in 1541, after the death of the previous governor, don Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin. In the same year, he participated in the Mixtón War in Nueva Galicia (Nahuatl: Xochipillan), led by viceroy Antonio de Mendoza. On 23 December 1546, a cédula was issued by Charles V and his mother Joanna granting don Diego a personal coat of arms in recognition of his service, particularly in the war in Nueva Galicia, and so that \"other [Indian] nobles will be inspired to serve us\".

Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape magazine, Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy. MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree[clarification needed], that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided.[citation needed] Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1988.

Within a few years he was running his own small fleet of bush aircraft including ski and float planes. His company delivered mail, freight, and supplies in the remote areas of the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and into the Yukon and Northwest Territories.

McConachie sold his Yukon Southern Air Transport to Canadian Pacific Air Lines in 1941. Created through the acquisition of a number of similar small airlines, the new airline appointed him its general manager. In 1947, the Board of Directors elected him CPA's president and he embarked on an expansion that made the company the second largest carrier in Canada and the dominant airline of the Canadian West. In 1949 McConachie obtained landing rights at the Tokyo and Hong Kong airports that opened the door to CPA's highly successful transpacific service to Australia, Asia and the South Pacific.

He has been president of the Royal Society (1990–1995), master of Trinity College, Cambridge (1990–1997), chancellor of the University of Leicester (1995–2005), and president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2005–2008). Since 1997, he has been an honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh. Atiyah's mathematical collaborators include Raoul Bott, Friedrich Hirzebruch and Isadore Singer, and his students include Graeme Segal, Nigel Hitchin and Simon Donaldson. Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for topological K-theory, an important tool in algebraic topology, which, informally speaking, describes ways in which spaces can be twisted. His best known result, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, was proved with Singer in 1963 and is widely used in counting the number of independent solutions to differential equations. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular instantons and monopoles, which are responsible for some subtle corrections in quantum field theory.

In the course of the 2014 Hong Kong electoral reform, OCLP intends to pressure the PRC Government into granting an electoral system which \"satisf[ies] the international standards in relation to universal suffrage\" in Hong Kong Chief Executive election in 2017 as promised according to the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45. Should such an electoral system not be achieved, OCLP sought to fight for equal suffrage in Hong Kong through civil disobedience means, namely the non-violent occupation of Central. In 2013 and 2014, OCLP organised three sessions for deliberation and a civic referendum on the voting system to use for the election of the chief executive in 2017. It then submitted to the government the proposal that citizens selected in the referendum. As a response to Beijing's rejection of the proposal, OCLP originally planned to launch the protest campaign on 1 October 2014, the National Day of the People's Republic of China. However, OCLP announced the commencement of Occupy Central on 28 September, in the midst of the heated week-long class boycott organised by Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) and Scholarism. The student strikes developed into a wave of demonstrations, which led to civil disobedience and an occupy movement of unprecedented scale. The protests gradually developed into a non-centralised occupy movement spreading to several areas of Hong Kong that was largely organised by volunteers. OCLP stated that the ongoing protest \"[was] the Umbrella Movement, not 'Occupy Central'\" and referred to themselves as supporters rather than the organisers of the protest. OCLP was disbanded by the founders when they surrendered to the police in December 2014.","passages":[{"passageId":"26059:36:291","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":36,"passageEnd":291,"passageText":"Occupy Central (Chinese: 佔領中環 or 佔中) was a civil disobedience campaign initiated by Benny Tai Yiu-ting, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Hong Kong, and advocated by Occupy Central with Love and Peace (organisation; OCLP; 讓愛與和平佔領中環 or 和平佔中).","facts":[]}]}

He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London and appointed to the Cavendish Professorship of Experimental Physics at the Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in 1884. In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles, which he calculated must have bodies much smaller than atoms and a very large value for their charge-to-mass ratio. Thus he is credited with the discovery and identification of the electron; and with the discovery of the first subatomic particle. Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and led to the development of the mass spectrograph. Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the electron and for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. Eight of his students, and his son George Paget Thomson, also became Nobel Prize winners either in physics or in chemistry (his record is comparable only to that of Arnold Sommerfeld).","passages":[{"passageId":"5292:127:313","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":127,"passageEnd":313,"passageText":"He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London and appointed to the Cavendish Professorship of Experimental Physics at the Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in 1884.","facts":[]}]}

Both books are concerned with apparently-virtuous environmental NGOs which operate in rural Scotland but which, in the point of view of the author, actually do damage to it. Mitchell is a critic of bodies like the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage, and has compared aspects of their behavior to that of the Nazis. Mitchell was founder and director of an organisation called \"People Too,\" described by him as an \"organisation founded to defend rural communities from the imposts of centralized bureaucracy.\"[citation needed] Mitchell has also written a book called The Cost of a Reputation, about the Aldington-Tolstoy libel trial which took place in London in 1989 and concerned the claims that a controversial British Army operation in May 1945 handed back tens of thousands of Cossack and Yugoslav refugees from Stalin and Tito, for the most part illegally, to the dictators. The book mainly concerned the London trial, at which (Mitchell claims) Lord Aldington, who had issued the illegal orders in 1945 as Staff Brigadier, perjured himself. In this, as an ex-Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party, he was assisted by both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defense.

{"fold":5,"source":"DBpedia Abstract","documentId":"16049","documentText":"David Charbonneau\n\nDavid Charbonneau is a Professor of Astronomy at Harvard University. His research focuses on the development of novel techniques for the detection and characterization of planets orbiting nearby, Sun-like stars. These distant worlds are called exoplanets. As a graduate student in 1999, he used a 4-inch telescope to make the first detection of an exoplanet eclipsing (or transiting) its parent star, which yielded the first ever constraint on the composition of a planet outside the Solar system. Charbonneau was a founding member of the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, which used a worldwide network of humble automated telescopes to survey hundreds of thousands of stars to detect 5 more exoplanets by this technique. Charbonneau also pioneered the use of space-based observatories to undertake the first studies of the atmospheres of these distant worlds: In 2001 he used the Hubble Space Telescope to study directly the chemical make-up of the atmosphere enshrouding one of these exoplanets, and in 2005, he led the team that used the Spitzer Space Telescope to made the first direct detection of the light emitted by an exoplanet. He is currently leading the NSF-funded MEarth Project and is a member of the NASA Kepler Mission Team. Each of these projects aims to detect Earth-like planets that might be suitable abodes for life beyond the Solar system. Charbonneau earned his PhD in astronomy from Harvard University, and received his undergraduate degree in math and physics from the University of Toronto. In 2004, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific awarded him the Robert J.

It is the lead agency in providing transportation and logistical support for the USO in bringing celebrity entertainers to troops. Armed Forces Entertainment typically showcases emerging artists but also features celebrity acts such as Kid Rock and Drew Carey. The responsible organization for overseas military entertainment has changed names and jurisdictions over its first five decades; from the United Services Organization Camp Shows to the U.S. Army’s Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Office (AFPEO) and resting in 2006 with the U.S. Air Force’s Armed Forces Entertainment office.

Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in a hospital for the prevention of disease outbreaks. After completing her doctoral thesis in 1916 from the University of Göttingen, she obtained an assistantship at the University of Freiburg. From reading the works of the reformer of the Carmelite Order, St. Teresa of Jesus, OCD, she was drawn to the Catholic Faith. She was baptized on 1 January 1922 into the Roman Catholic Church. At that point she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentors. She then taught at a Catholic school of education in Speyer.

The region is located northeast of New England, southeast of Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, and southwest of the island of Newfoundland. The notion of a Maritime Union has been proposed at various times in Canada's history; the first discussions in 1864 at the Charlottetown Conference contributed to Canadian Confederation which instead formed the larger Dominion of Canada.

(James Curtis) Riley, at the age of 17, drove to Austin, Texas from his home in Hunter, Texas, some 45 miles. He was in a Model 'T' car with his uncle. The purpose of this trip was to obtain a beer license for his soon-to-be beer joint. It was now at the end of prohibition. He camped out on the steps of the Capital building and waited for it to open. He was the first person in line in Texas and got the first beer license! Riley kept the tavern operational until 1991, about 58 years. Prior to Riley taking over the place and before prohibition, the joint was known as the Galloway Saloon. The main part of the building has been dated around the mid-1800s. By the way, Riley's mother was a Galloway. Mr. Riley died in 1992 and is buried in York Creek Cemetery, not more than 2 miles from his joint and where he was born.

SWIFT also sells software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFTNet Network, and ISO 9362. Business Identifier Codes (BICs, previously Bank Identifier Codes) are popularly known as \"SWIFT codes\". The majority of international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. As of September 2010, SWIFT linked more than 9,000 financial institutions in 209 countries and territories, who were exchanging an average of over 15 million messages per day (compared to an average of 2.4 million daily messages in 1995). SWIFT transports financial messages in a highly secure way but does not hold accounts for its members and does not perform any form of clearing or settlement. SWIFT does not facilitate funds transfer: rather, it sends payment orders, which must be settled by correspondent accounts that the institutions have with each other. Each financial institution, to exchange banking transactions, must have a banking relationship by either being a bank or affiliating itself with one (or more) so as to enjoy those particular business features. SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law owned by its member financial institutions with offices around the world. SWIFT headquarters, designed by Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura are in La Hulpe, Belgium, near Brussels. The chairman of SWIFT is Yawar Shah, originally from Pakistan, and its CEO is Gottfried Leibbrandt, originally from the Netherlands.

He grew up in Kitchener, Ontario, and earned a degree in Environmental Studies at the University of Waterloo in 1985. Having played for four years on the Waterloo Warriors football team, he pursued a career in professional football, at a weight of 290 lbs. and 6'3\". In the 1980s, he attended training camps with the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Montreal Alouettes. Scott pursued his football career until a serious knee injury caused a blood clot that almost killed him and rendered him incapable of continuing in the sport. Although told by doctors that he would probably never walk again, Manning slowly regained his mobility. After two years of recovery, Manning decided that he simply \"wanted to fly jets in airshows\" and set out pursuing private and commercial pilot's licences and eventually earned flight time in some of the world's most advanced aerobatic aircraft. In 1990 he purchased and decided to construct \"The Stinger\" BD-5J Microjet airplane kit. Construction work took over 6000 work hours. At the end of several engine malfunctions, and countless technical hiccups, his BD-5J emerged as a tiny, but formidable competitor in the airshow circuit and aerobatics arena. Manning piloted his own plane, and was known as the tallest BD-5 pilot in the world, and the operator of the only BD-5J model in Canada.

In April 2005, the Press Scrutiny Board was renamed the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division. In 2009, a medical malpractice incident that resulted in the death of a young girl, which was widely reported in local Burmese media prompted a crackdown in censorship by the PSRD.

Scholars disagree on the year of Mitsunobu's birth, placing it in either 1561 or 1565. The earliest record of his involvement on any major project was in conjunction with his father's commission to paint elements of Oda Nobunaga's Azuchi Castle. He also worked with his father on a number of other major castles and palaces, including Osaka Castle, Kyoto Gosho, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Jurakudai palace. After his father's death in 1590, Mitsunobu became the head of the family and of the school. He took over the Kyoto Imperial Palace project, and continued to receive many illustrious commissions. However, in part due to his poor leadership skills and political ability, he lost many commissions and patrons to the rival Hasegawa school of painting. While a master of the fundamental Kanō school style, and that of his father, Mitsunobu expressed elements of his own preferences and skills in his paintings. His color paintings of flowers, trees and similar subjects made extensive use of gold-leaf as most Kanō paintings did, but also displayed a delicate, elegant, and gentle lightness.","passages":[{"passageId":"20578:547:639","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":547,"passageEnd":639,"passageText":"After his father's death in 1590, Mitsunobu became the head of the family and of the school.","facts":[]}]}

Jérôme's mother's marriage had been annulled by order of Jérôme's uncle, French Emperor Napoleon I. The annulment caused the rescission of his right to carry the Bonaparte name; though the ruling was later reversed by his cousin, Napoleon III. It is speculated that Jérôme's prospective title is a reason the 11th Congress of the United States in 1810 proposed the Titles of Nobility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would strip an American of his citizenship if he accepted a title of nobility from a foreign nation. The amendment has never been approved, lacking the approval of only two state legislatures at that time. He married Susan May Williams, and it is from them that the American line of the Bonaparte family descended.

He was the Mayor of Irvine, California in the late 1970s. He has held the post of President of the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, served on the Orange County Airport Land Use Commission, Director of the County Sanitation Districts of Orange County, and on the Orange County Transportation Commission. An engineer educated at the University of Pittsburgh, he later received a Master Degree in Engineering at USC and an MBA from California State University, Long Beach. Vardoulis promoted the visionary plan for toll roads in 1980, which have now been nearly completed. He recently proposed a concept for an 11-mile transportation tunnel under the Cleveland National Forest that would connect the 133 Toll Road in Orange County to the I-15 Freeway in Riverside County. The roadways would actually include three tunnels which could also carry rail traffic, a water transmission line, high-voltage transmission cables and other uses. Transportation agencies in Orange and Riverside Counties have done preliminary review of the concept and have put it on hold due to the potentially high cost at this point. He served as President of Church Engineering, a Civil Engineering firm, prior to its sale in late 1992. He then founded BV Engineering where he served as CEO until its sale in 2004.

This could be a reference to Zeus, the god of lightning/Jupiter, so \"lightning-struck\" could be saying that the person was blessed (struck) by Zeus (/lightning/fortune).

He was born the son of a carpenter at Chêne, a small village some 3 kilometers from Geneva. At eighteen, he left to tour France and developed a career undertaking the design and direction of civil engineering works. He was not well schooled, but studied the principal bases of such sciences as were to be useful to him, and took evening classes to make up for what was lacking in his early instruction; not that he hoped to make a complete study for an engineer, but only to learn the indispensable. He was, according to a colleague \"before all things, a practical man, who made up for the enforced insufficiency of his technical knowledge by a coup d'œil (glance) of surprising accuracy\". In 1872 he was invited to build a tunnel through the Gotthard massif, connecting Switzerland to the Italian border. The project was, for the time, a vast undertaking, verging on folly according to many critics. Construction of the tunnel was accompanied by very considerable loss of life and escalation of cost, arising out of the novelty of the endeavour and the most insurmountable difficulties which presented themselves. Favre bore the brunt of continued criticism, including that deflected on to him by the board of the St. Gothard Company. In spite of this, the cost of the tunnel per running foot was a third less than that of the great Mont Cenis Tunnel.

Torres is the family winery with the most extensive vineyards in the Denomination of Origin (DO) of Penedès and the largest winery in Spain. They also run the Miguel Torres Chile winery in the Chilean Central Valley, and in the United States (California) where in 1986 Marimar Torres founded Marimar Estate. In Spain outside of the Torres family's native Penedès region, they own vineyards in DO Conca de Barberà, DO Toro, DO Jumilla, DO Ribera del Duero, DOQ Priorat and most recently in DOC Rioja - in the last three areas with new wineries or wineries under construction. Likewise, Torres is also Spain's largest producer of DO wines under its own label, exporting to more than 140 countries. Under the Torres brand name they trade wine and brandy under on a range of different labels. Some of these are Viña Sol, Sangre de Toro, De Casta, Coronas, Atrium and Viña Esmeralda, with their best known brandies being Torres 5 and Torres 10. Many Torres wines are produced from international rather than traditional Spanish grape varieties and are varietally labelled. The company exports wines to over 140 countries.[citation needed] Torres made two significant contributions to the development of enology in Spain: firstly, the use of fermentation at controlled temperatures, and secondly, the maturing of the wine in small oak barrels during a scrupulously defined time, as has been a habitual practice in Bordeaux.[citation needed] Torres is managed by the fourth generation of the Torres family; Miguel A. Torres is the company’s current President and Managing Director. The Torres family are founding members of the Primum Familiae Vini.","passages":[{"passageId":"22297:523:789","exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties":[],"passageStart":523,"passageEnd":789,"passageText":"In Spain outside of the Torres family's native Penedès region, they own vineyards in DO Conca de Barberà, DO Toro, DO Jumilla, DO Ribera del Duero, DOQ Priorat and most recently in DOC Rioja - in the last three areas with new wineries or wineries under construction.","facts":[]}]}
